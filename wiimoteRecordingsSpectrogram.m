% Generates spectrogram using fixed length overlapping window fourier transform 
% Currently, the "arc" is not computed in wiimoteRecordingsPreprocess.m,
% which is required to compute speed here 
% (uncomment the corresponding lines in wiimoteRecordingsPreprocessFixedLen.m to compute arc 
% and wiimoteRecordingsSpectrogram.m to compute speed)
